What I did:
1.  clone the MasterUI branch into eclipse via egit
2.  Imported the MasterUI branch from git into eclipse workspace via "import projects"
3.  Moved Gameboard.java into the src folder
4.  Commented out "package masterui" from the top of the file
5.  Run Gameboard.java
6.  Saw a window pop-up containing
    * Map
    * Notes
    * Cards held by player
    * list of checkboxes for each player character
    * list of checkboxes for 9 rooms
    * list of checkboxes for 6 weapons
    
Things that may need fixing:
1.  Vertical hallways are misaligned
